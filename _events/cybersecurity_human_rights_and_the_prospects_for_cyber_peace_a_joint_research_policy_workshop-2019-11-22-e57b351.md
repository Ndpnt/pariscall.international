Following on the Spring 2017 Ostrom Cybersecurity Colloquium, IU Ostrom Workshop, NYU, GEODE (Universit√© Paris 8) and IRSEM are pleased to announce a special follow-up Workshop focused on the prospects of cyber peace. The Cyber Peace Workshop (CPW) seeks participation from scholars, policymakers, practitioners, and civil society groups interested in exploring the meaning and promise of cyber peace, ranging from the promotion of cybersecurity due diligence to protecting human rights online to making democracy harder to hack. In an environment increasingly beset by cyber insecurity, we seek to begin laying out an agenda for how to achieve a positive cyber peace for the twenty first century
