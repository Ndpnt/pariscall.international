The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) is a multi-stakeholder forum for policy dialogue on issues of
Internet governance. It brings together all stakeholders in the Internet governance debate, whether they
represent governments, the private sector or civil society, including the technical and academic
community, on an equal basis and through an open and inclusive process.
