Cyberspace now plays a crucial role in every aspect of our lives and
it is the shared responsibility of a wide variety of actors, in their
respective roles, to improve trust, security and stability in
cyberspace.

We reaffirm our support to an open, secure, stable, accessible and
peaceful cyberspace, which has become an integral component of
life in all its social, economic, cultural and political aspects.

We also reaffirm that international law, including the United Nations
Charter in its entirety, international humanitarian law and customary
international law is applicable to the use of information and
communication technologies (ICT) by States.

We reaffirm that the same rights that people have offline must also
be protected online, and also reaffirm the applicability of
international human rights law in cyberspace.

We reaffirm that international law, together with the voluntary norms
of responsible State behavior during peacetime and associated
confidence and capacity-building measures developed within the
United Nations, is the foundation for international peace and security
in cyberspace.

We condemn malicious cyber activities in peacetime, notably the
ones threatening or resulting in significant, indiscriminate or
systemic harm to individuals and critical infrastructure and welcome
calls for their improved protection.

We also welcome efforts by States and non-state actors to provide
support to victims of malicious use of ICTs on an impartial and
independent basis, whenever it occurs, whether during or outside of
armed conflict.
