We recognize that the threat of cyber criminality requires more effort
to improve the security of the products we use, to strengthen our
defenses against criminals and to promote cooperation among all
stakeholders, within and across national borders, and that the
Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is a key tool in this regard.

We recognize the responsibilities of key private sector actors in
improving trust, security and stability in cyberspace and encourage
initiatives aimed at strengthening the security of digital processes,
products and services.

We welcome collaboration among governments, the private sector
and civil society to create new cybersecurity standards that enable
infrastructures and organizations to improve cyber protections.

We recognize all actors can support a peaceful cyberspace by
encouraging the responsible and coordinated disclosure of
vulnerabilities.

We underline the need to enhance broad digital cooperation and
increase capacity-building efforts by all actors and encourage
initiatives that build user resilience and capabilities.

We recognize the necessity of a strengthened multistakeholder
approach and of additional efforts to reduce risks to the stability of
cyberspace and to build-up confidence, capacity and trust.
