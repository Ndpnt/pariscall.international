### Protecting software distributed under open source licenses: the Linux Foundation supports communities that share their knowledge

In a world whose dynamics are based on sharing of knowledge, the free software model and the application of free software licenses become increasingly important. Open source software is equipped with legal tools such as copyleft to frame the involvement on a cooperative basis and a reciprocal gift-giving logic, to produce highly performing software and to prevent private appropriation of codes or theft of intellectual property, since what is voluntarily shared cannot be re-appropriated.

The open source software model offers a way to reconcile private individual interest and collective efficiency: it is not a question of abandoning intellectual authorship, but to allow reuse of the free software created under the condition that any new version can also circulate freely.
Hence intellectual property shared under such licenses spreads more quickly in the industrial fabric and benefits from network effects, which support the push for creating standards that evolve around it and its promoters.

With over 1,000 corporate members worldwide, The Linux Foundation provides strong support to open source communities through financial and intellectual resources, infrastructure, services, events, and training. Working together, the Linux Foundation and its projects form one of the most ambitious and successful investments in the creation of shared technology: the collective value of the code in Linux Foundation projects is estimated at roughly US$16 billion.

### Balancing between protection and access in face of new digital threats: the Center for Internet & Society India participates in international negotiations on intellectual property

Managing intellectual property (IP) in the cyberspace raises numerous challenges. It is necessary for companies and authors to protect IP in the digital world, which fuels innovation, differentiation and revenue. Copyrights, patents and trademarks are an important part of the digital landscape.

As malware and malicious practices develop, companies and individuals may suffer loss due to IP theft or infringement and need to develop more sophisticated protection systems. At the same time, access to information plays an important role in terms of education and innovation. The evolving information infrastructure and new threats may upset the balance between the two.

In India, the Center for Internet and Society defends the position that the balance between protection and access must be re-calibrated in the cyberspace. As such, the Center has participated in negotiations taking place at regional and international levels through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (RCEP) and the World Intellectual Property Organization Standing Committee on Copyright and Related-rights (WIPO-SCCR). In addition, the Center conducts its own empirical research on IP and ICT.
