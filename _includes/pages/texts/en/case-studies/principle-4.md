### Balancing between protection and access in face of new digital threats: the Center for Internet & Society India participates in international negotiations on intellectual property

Managing intellectual property (IP) in the cyberspace raises numerous challenges. It is necessary for companies and authors to protect IP in the digital world, which fuels innovation, differentiation and revenue. Copyrights, patents and trademarks are an important part of the digital landscape.

As malware and malicious practices develop, companies and individuals may suffer loss due to IP theft or infringement and need to develop more sophisticated protection systems. At the same time, access to information plays an important role in terms of education and innovation. The evolving information infrastructure and new threats may upset the balance between the two.

In India, the Center for Internet and Society defends the position that the balance between protection and access must be re-calibrated in the cyberspace. As such, the Center has participated in negotiations taking place at regional and international levels through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (RCEP) and the World Intellectual Property Organization Standing Committee on Copyright and Related-rights (WIPO-SCCR). In addition, the Center conducts its own empirical research on IP and ICT.
