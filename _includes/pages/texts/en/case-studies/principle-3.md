### Protecting the integrity of democratic elections: The Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity (TCEI) helps advancing solutions

Election interference is a major threat to the universal right of people to take part in the democratic process. Still, democratic governments and technology companies around the world are scrambling to meet the challenges of the latest election meddling tactics and technologies. This is a global phenomenon, with instances of election interference seen in countries from Mexico to North-Macedonia, Ukraine to Kenya, Taiwan to Turkey.

Yet, attacks and coordinated manipulation are no longer coming from foreign malign powers alone: increasingly, the cross-border disinformation playbook is used by domestic actors trying to sow division and polarization in both authoritarian and democratic contexts.

The TCEI brings together committed and eminent persons from different backgrounds with one shared goal: to ensure people decide freely, based on independent information, who should represent them. Transatlantic and bipartisan in nature, the TCEI seeks to share best practice between decision-makers and institutions across the democratic world, raise public awareness about the risks of interference while applying on the ground new models and technologies to empower civil society and governments to defend democracy. The TCEI is an initiative of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation founded by Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2017.

### Countering election interference: Microsoft and the Alliance for Securing Democracy partner to prevent malign interference by foreign actors

Microsoft and the Alliance for Securing Democracy are building a community of partners to counter election interference, which will bring together representatives from government, industry and civil society in order to strengthen the capacity to prevent malign interference by foreign actors in electoral processes.

Recognizing that the growing challenge that cyber threats pose to electoral processes is part of a broader, multifaceted threat to democratic institutions, Microsoft and the Alliance for Securing Democracy, together with a government partner, have chosen to formalize their collaboration by partnering in a community dedicated to these topics.

Together, the two organizations will work to raise global awareness of the threat cyberattacks pose to elections and democratic institutions and convene key stakeholders to advance thinking on what constitutes foreign interference in elections, track the tools and tactics used to undermine democratic institutions and processes, and develop best practices and policy responses to secure elections and other democratic processes from cyber-enabled threats. Microsoft and the Alliance for Securing Democracy will also assist likeminded partners in capacity building by developing mechanisms to facilitate information sharing on emerging trends, driving industry collaboration to support smaller organizations that lack resources to develop their own capabilities, and conducting threat simulation exercises designed to produce actionable solutions.
