### The Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity (TCEI) helps advancing solutions to protect the integrity of democratic elections

Election interference is a major threat to the universal right of people to take part in the democratic process. Still, democratic governments and technology companies around the world are scrambling to meet the challenges of the latest election meddling tactics and technologies. This is a global phenomenon, with instances of election interference seen in countries from Mexico to North-Macedonia, Ukraine to Kenya, Taiwan to Turkey.

Yet, attacks and coordinated manipulation are no longer coming from foreign malign powers alone: increasingly, the cross-border disinformation playbook is used by domestic actors trying to sow division and polarization in both authoritarian and democratic contexts.

The TCEI brings together committed and eminent persons from different backgrounds with one shared goal: to ensure people decide freely, based on independent information, who should represent them. Transatlantic and bipartisan in nature, the TCEI seeks to share best practice between decision-makers and institutions across the democratic world, raise public awareness about the risks of interference while applying on the ground new models and technologies to empower civil society and governments to defend democracy. The TCEI is an initiative of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation founded by Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2017.

### Microsoft launched the Defending Democracy Program to protect voting systems and the technology infrastructure of political campaigns

Threats to democratic institutions and processes from cyber-enabled interference have become a critical concern. We have seen attempts by nation-states to target and exploit key building blocks of our democratic system including voting systems and the technology infrastructure of political campaigns. We have also seen the manipulation of social media platforms to sow misinformation. Addressing these threats to democracy will require significant new efforts by governments, technology companies – both on their own and through partnerships – as well as academia and civil society.

To address these challenges, Microsoft launched the Defending Democracy Program in 2018. Since its creation, the program has focused on protecting campaigns, stopping disinformation and safeguarding elections. Taking place in half the world’s democracies across 5 continents, it has trained more than 1000 political professionals through cybersecurity workshops. In addition, it has launched new products and services such as AccountGuard, now available in more than 25 countries – and although this service is relatively new, Microsoft has already emitted more than 750 notifications of nation-state attacks targeting organizations participating in AccountGuard.

Additional initiatives have included the launch of ElectionGuard, a free open-source software development kit, which will  make voting more secure, accessible and efficient, and M365 for Campaigns, designed to bring the advanced security capabilities of Microsoft 365 Business offering to federal political campaigns.
