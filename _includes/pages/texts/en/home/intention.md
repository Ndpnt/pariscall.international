## Gathering around principles

The Paris Call proposes to act on a set of **nine common principles for securing cyberspace**, which are all areas for reflection and action.

It invites all cyberspace stakeholders to collaborate, and proposes that States act together and engage with partners from the private sector, research and civil society to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected online and in the physical world.

It allows all actors who wish to preserve peace and security of people to **demonstrate their commitment**.
