## Ensuring international cyberspace security

The digital revolution has sped up the emergence of a global digital space. This digital space, the “cyberspace”, is the communication space made of network infrastructure (such as servers and cables), devices (like computers and smartphones), software (both human-machine and machine-to-machine interfaces) and data carried over the network.

**Cyberspace provides major opportunities for innovation, economic progress, cultural development and access to information.** While its quick development has proved hugely useful for many human activities, it also brings new threats.

New and dangerous practices are developing in cyberspace: cybercrime, information manipulation, political or economic espionage, attacks on critical infrastructure or individuals, theft of personal information or confidential data, compromise of information and communications systems used by citizens, companies and agencies… These attacks can come from State or non-State groups that respect no borders.

These attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and intense. It is thus essential to **bring the international community together to ensure peace and security in the digital space**.
