## Ensuring international cyberspace security

**The digital revolution has sped up the emergence of a global digital space**. This digital space, or “cyberspace”, is the communication space made up of network infrastructure (such as servers and cables), digital devices (like computers and telephones), software (human-machine interfaces and communication protocols between machines) and data carried by the network.

The digital space provides major opportunities for innovation, economic progress, cultural development and access to information. While its quick development has proved hugely useful for many human activities, it also brings new threats.

New and dangerous practices are developing in cyberspace: cybercrime, spread of false information and manipulation, political or economic espionage, attacks on critical infrastructure or individuals, theft of personal information or confidential data, compromising of information and communications systems used by citizens, companies and administrations, etc.These attacks can come from State or non-State groups, which respect no borders.

In the face of these attacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated and intense, it is essential to **bring the international community together to ensure peace and security in the digital space**.
