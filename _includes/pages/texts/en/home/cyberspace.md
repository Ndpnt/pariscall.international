## For a peaceful digital space

Digital space, or "cyberspace", is all the interconnected digital devices, software and all the data processed in it: our computers, telephones, emails, websites, bank accounts, online shopping servicesâ€¦

Cyberspace has become the support for a large part of human activities. It is a space for opportunities, exchanges and collaboration. But the more important it is, the more threats it poses.

**Conflicts in the physical world are transposed into cyberspace**, which can become the scene of military operations through cyber attacks and information manipulation: stealing personal information, confidential data, but also preventing access to a service or even changing the functioning of physical infrastructures or influencing elections.

While not all cyber attacks are terrorism or inter-State warfare, they are notremain no less dangerous and can threaten the proper functioning of our vital infrastructure.

For example, the [WannaCry cyber attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry) in May 2017 blocked access to computers and erased data from individuals and large companies, public hospitals and rail networks, **paralysing critical communication, mobility and health services**.

Cyberspace is increasingly at the centre of our lives and the threats to it will undoubtedly increase.That is why it is crucial to **bring the international community together to ensure peace and security in the digital world** as well as in the physical world.
