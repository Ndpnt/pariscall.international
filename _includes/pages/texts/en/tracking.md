## Personal data collection

If you choose to do so, you can send us information through interactive forms, for example to suggest that an organisation or an event is listed on this website. The only personal data that can be sent through these means are email addresses.

### Data controller

The entity responsible for handling your data is the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

### Data usage

The email addresses you specify are used only for the purpose stated in the forms:

- to confirm your suggestions;
- for discussions regarding specifically your support of the Call;
- to send regular information about the Call through newsletters.

You can request your personal data to be sent to you, updated or deleted at any time by [sending us an email](mailto:paris.call@diplomatie.gouv.fr?subject=Personal%20data) or by postal mail to _Délégué général à la protection des données, 27 rue de la Convention, 75732 Paris Cedex 15, France_.

_Please note that if through removal of all contact email addresses, we do not have any way to reach your organisation anymore, we may remove public mentions of your support._

### Data retention

- The email address you use to suggest events will only be kept for the time needed to confirm the event.
- The email address you specify for newsletters will only be kept as long as you are subscribed to them. You can unsubscribe at any time through the link given at the bottom of each email.
- The email address you specify as an official representative of your organization to confirm the support of the Call will be kept as long as your organization supports the Call.

### Data sharing

We may share your contact information with event organisers for gatherings we organise, such as the Paris Peace Forum, so that they can invite your organisation.

## Visits tracking

When you visit this website, we leave a small text file (a “cookie”) on your computer. This allows us to measure how many visits we’ve had and which pages are most viewed.

### Why doesn’t this website show a consent banner for cookies?

Because the analytics software we use, [Matomo](https://www.matomo.org), is open-source, self-managed, and set up to properly anonymize your data and is thus exempt from prior consent according to the French data protection authority CNIL’s [recommendations](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/solutions-pour-la-mesure-daudience).

### I contribute to your data, can I access it?

Of course! The analytics data for this website are publicly available on [stats.data.gouv.fr](https://stats.data.gouv.fr/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=98&period=range&date=previous30)
